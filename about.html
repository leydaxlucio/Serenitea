				<h3>The Origins of the Afternoon Tea Party</h3>

			</div>

			<div class="imgtext1">


				<div class="text">

					<h4>Extensive History</h4>
					<p>Tea parties have a long and illustrious history that dates back centuries, and they have evolved significantly over time. Tea has been enjoyed for centuries, and its popularity as a beverage spread throughout Europe in the 17th century. The first recorded tea party in England was held in 1662 by Catherine of Braganza, the Portuguese wife of King Charles II.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Originally a custom of the wealthy elite in Europe, tea parties became more popular and accessible to the general public in the 19th and 20th centuries. Tea parties were once elaborate affairs with strict rules and protocols, held in the afternoon and featuring a variety of tea and food items. The rich and the powerful held tea parties to show off their social standing and entertain guests in extravagance.</p>

					<h4>Evolution</h4>
					<p>As tea became more affordable and widely available, tea parties evolved into a more casual and relaxed affair, with a focus on socializing and enjoying the calming effects of a warm cup of tea. Today, tea parties can range from formal, traditional gatherings to more laid-back, informal events, depending on the preferences of the host and guests.</p>
					<br>
					<p>There are many customs and traditions associated with tea parties, such as the proper way to serve and drink tea, the use of tea strainers and teaspoons, and the presentation of food items. Some people strictly adhere to these traditions, while others prefer a more modern or relaxed approach to tea parties.</p>
